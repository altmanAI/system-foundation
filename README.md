# system-foundation
AltmanAI System Foundation is the canonical, checksummed backbone of our platform - governance, safety, and launch network in one place. Trust-Lock v1.2, PAIHI verification, minted PDFs and receipts, and public scorecards. Build logs, releases, and proofs that benefit people while driving risk down. Public by default; accountable by design. Always.
